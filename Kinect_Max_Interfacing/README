Kinect Max Interface Readme

---------------------------------------

Installation:
 - Windows:

Installation on Windows is kind of a pain, and, if using Windows 8, must be done after rebooting into unsigned driver mode.

Download either: 
OpenNI_NITE_Installer-win32-0.27.zip or 
OpenNI_NITE_Installer-win64-0.27.zip 
from (https://code.google.com/p/simple-openni/downloads/list?can=1&q=&colspec=Filename+Summary+Uploaded+ReleaseDate+Size+DownloadCount)

Note: I chose the 64 bit version (win64), but the 32 bit version should work fine as well. 
If you choose the 32 bit version, just replace any instances of "64" in these instructions with "32"

Unzip that file into a temporary directory.

Install the 4 files in that directory in this order:
openni-win64-1.5.4.0-dev.msi
sensor-win64-5.1.2.1-redist.msi
SensorKinect092-Bin-Win64-v5.1.2.1.msi
nite-win64-1.5.2.21-dev.msi

After installing all of these packages, reboot your computer.

Next, plug the Kinect into your computer. Windows should find and install the correct drivers automatically.

If a new device installation window comes up, select the option that says "Browse my computer for drivers" and
browse to the "C:\Program Files\PrimeSense\SensorKinect\Driver" folder. Windows should then set the Kinect up with 
the correct drivers.

If the Kinect still doesn't work, you should open Device Manager (open the Control Panel, click System and Security, 
and click Device Manager under System) and look for a strange entry. [TODO - will elaborate later] Right click on
that entry and select "Update Drivers". When the window comes up, select "Browse my computer for drivers" and
browse to the "C:\Program Files\PrimeSense\SensorKinect\Driver" folder. Windows should then set the Kinect up with 
the correct drivers.

Finally, download Synapse for Windows from (http://synapsekinect.tumblr.com/post/6305020721/download)
and run their installer. If you encounter problems, there are installation instructions 
here (http://synapsekinect.tumblr.com/post/6698860570/windows-install-instructions). Just 
start from Step 6, since you've already completed the earlier steps.

- OS X: 

Installation on OS X is significantly easier.

Download Synapse for Mac from (http://synapsekinect.tumblr.com/post/6305020721/download)
Unzip the application file to whatever folder you want to run it from (the Applications folder is a good option).
Plug in your Kinect and run the Synapse application.
